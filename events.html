      <dt>Christmas events</dt>
      <dd>From large holiday parties to intimate Christmas Eve dinners, make your restaurant the place to be this holiday season. Be inspired by Michelin-starred Pru and their Christmas Eve experience – a 6-course menu with premium beverage pairing.

        Christmas events aren’t reserved for fine-dining establishments. Sliders in Copenhagen makes use of the holiday season by attracting smaller crowds hungry for something besides the usual Christmas fare (julefrokost in Danish).
